# CSC510 SmartVoter

This is a voting app for a class project. It is forked from the code of an Udacity tutorial: [Firebase in a Weekend: Android by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) Udacity course.

## Overview


## Setup

Using Android studio, from the main menu bar, go to File->New->Project From Version Control->git
 to check out this project.
 
Run->Run 'app'
	Create a new Virtual Divice if you havent yet:
	Select a Nexus 5X API 26(Android 8.0.0, API 26)

Once the virtual device is up, drag to the virtual device's screen the com.google.android.gms_12.2.21_(270-188803320)-12221270_minAPI21(x86)(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk
which is in the root folder of this repository. This will install an update to the device's google play, so that you don't have to use your google credentials to update it.
